Practice Assignment
========================================================

The goal of this assignment is to provide a "bridge" between the first two weeks of lectures and assignment 1 for those either new to R or struggling with how to approach the assignment.

This guided example, will **not** provide a solution for programming assignment 1.  However, it will guide you through some core concepts and give you some practical experience to hopefully make assignment 1 seems less daunting.

To begin, download this file and unzip it into your R working directory.  
http://s3.amazonaws.com/practice_assignment/diet_data.zip

You can do  this in R with the following code:
```{r}
dataset_url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/practice_assignment/diet_data.zip"
download.file(dataset_url, "diet_data.zip")
unzip("diet_data.zip", exdir = "diet_data")
```


If you're not sure where your working directory is, you can find out with the getwd() command.  Alternatively, you can view/change it through the Tools > Global Options menu in R Studio.

So assuming you've unzipped the file into your R directory, you should have a folder called diet_data.  In that folder there are five files.  Let's get a list of those files:

```{r}
list.files("diet_data")
